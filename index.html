            <h2>Remembering Pastor Ernest Qwero</h2>
            <p>The Vanuatu Mission (VM) is mourning the death of Pastor Ernest Qwero (53), who died on February 5 after a prolonged battle with illness while serving at the Eton Adventist Church on Efate.</p>
            <p>"With a total of 23 years of service to the mission field, Pastor Qwero was a tireless and humble worker who never turned down God's calling, no matter where he was posted," said VM president Pastor Charlie Jimmy. "His dedication to spreading the gospel and caring for the spiritual needs of his congregation and communities made him a beloved figure within the mission."</p>
            <p>Pastor Qwero began his journey in ministry in 2001 as a layman. He obtained a bachelor's degree in theology from Fulton Adventist University College in 2010. From there, he went on to serve in a variety of roles in VM, including as a local church pastor and district ministry leader in various districts.</p>
            <p>On June 12, 2012, he was ordained as a pastor during the Seventh-day Adventist Church's 100-year celebrations at Saralana Park in Port Vila.</p>
            <p>"Though Pastor Qwero faced several years of illness, his faith remained unshaken, and he continued to serve with love and passion until his final days," said Pastor Jimmy. "His death leaves a deep void in the hearts of many who knew him, but his legacy of unwavering service to God will live on in the lives he touched throughout his ministry."</p>
            <p>Born on January 29, 1971, Pastor Qwero was later married to Naly Meta. Together they had five children.</p>
            <p>"VM extends its heartfelt condolences to the family of Pastor Qwero, as well as to the many communities that were blessed by his ministry," said Pastor Jimmy.</p>
            <p>Pastor Qweroâ€™s body was flown to his village of Vandue for burial.</p>
